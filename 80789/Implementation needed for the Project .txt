Rest of the Project to be Implemented :-

Using an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU)

IMU in a collision avoidance project can enhance the system's understanding of the vehicle's motion and dynamics.
 
 An IMU is typically a combination of accelerometers, gyroscopes, and magnetometers.( Magnetometers are optional).
 
 An IMU consists of piezoelectric crystal: 
 
 The piezoelectric crystal converts the force acting upon it into electrical signals, which can enhance safety by accurately measuring a vehicleâ€™s motion, enabling collision avoidance.
 
We can implement Hepatic feedbacks to the driver alerting Driver about collision warning based upon Driving Conditions.
